He lands in the year 802701: the world has been transformed by a society living in apparent harmony and bliss, but as the Traveler stays in the future he discovers a hidden barbaric and depraved subterranean class. Wells&apos;s transparent commentary on the capitalist society was an instant bestseller and launched the time-travel genre.<br /> <br /><i>The Time Machine <\/i>inspired the international bestseller <i>The Map of Time <\/i>by<i> <\/i>Félix J. Palma. As a gift to our readers, we are including the first three chapters of <i>The Map of Time<\/i> in this ebook edition.  ",

      "description": "Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (1871) is a novel by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson), the sequel to Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland (1865). Set some six months later than the earlier book, Alice again enters a fantastical world, this time by climbing through a mirror into the world that she can see beyond it. Though not quite as popular as Wonderland, Through the Looking-Glass includes such celebrated verses as &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; and &quot;The Walrus and the Carpenter&quot;, and the episode involving Tweedledum and Tweedledee.",
